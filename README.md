<h1>Library Management System</h1>

This was a group project for COP3330 (Object Oriented Programming) and the main purpose of it is to simulate a library management system.
It's purpose was to develop our Object Oriented Programming skills by having us working with concepts such as Inheritance and Polymorphism, which are the key to go deeper into more complex OOP applications.

I expect to do a GUI for this project at some point but that's not something I will be focusing on for a while.
